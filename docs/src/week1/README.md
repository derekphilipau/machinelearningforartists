# Week 1

## Questions

How did the invention of photography influence painting?  What about digital image tools like Photoshop?  How might recent developments in 3D printing and machine learning affect art?

## 3D Digitization

A number of different methods using 3D scanning (using light) and photogammetry (using photos) have been developed to non-obtrusively scan objects in three dimensions.  Scanning systems range from expensive professional systems to cheap consumer products that can be used with a normal mobile phone camera or even drones.  The resulting 3d models can then be manipulated and printed using 3D CNC & printing techniques.

Recently, museums have undertaken 3D digitization projects in order to better study & understand objects through 3D representations.  Very soon, many museums will have full 3D catalogs of their objects which we will be able to use for research, 3D modeling, and even machine learning.

## 3D & ML

In these three papers published less than three years apart, you can see that it won't be long until we have consumer tools to automatically create 3D models from just a single photograph.

## Create a 3D Model of Someone

In this tutorial, we're going to use PIFuHD to generate a 3D model from just a single photograph.  We can then use that model object in various 3D programs.
