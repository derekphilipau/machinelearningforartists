# Introduction

This is a free, experimental, month-long introductory course for current students in the Visual Arts.  The goal of this course is for students to learn how to incorporate machine learning into their creative process. Students will learn how to use freely available machine learning software to generate images, video, and text.  Students will create and share the art that they develop during this course.

This course will use Google Colab Pro, which costs $10/mo.  Students will be expected to pay for this subscription during the duration of the course (one-month minimum).  This subscription is the only financial cost of this course.  Students will need access to a computer with a web browser.

Students do not need to know how to program, although some programming experience will be helpful.  Working in Google Colab Pro requires the use of basic command-line arguments.

Students who enroll will be expected to join the weekly classes (1.5 hours) and work on their own projects (3-5 hours per week).
